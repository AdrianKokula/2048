# 2️⃣0️⃣4️⃣8️⃣

This is my implementation of 2048 in C++ with ncurses library. UI is adapting to your terminal window, but does not react to resize events. Some minimum terminal height and width is required...

## Features
- choose your board size
  - 3x3 board - small
  - 4x4 board - original / medium
  - 5x5 board - big
- high score table - save your biggest score
